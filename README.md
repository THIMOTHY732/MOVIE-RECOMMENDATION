# Movie Recommendation System

## üìñ Project Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** is designed to suggest movies based on user preferences. By leveraging the **Pandas** library, this system calculates correlations to recommend similar movies. The goal is to provide users with personalized movie suggestions.

This project is an extension of the following repository: [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/THIMOTHY732/MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION.git).  
The dataset used is a subset of the **MovieLens Dataset**.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Correlation-Based Recommendations**: Finds movies similar to the one the user inputs.
- **Interactive Input**: Includes a text input bar for users to input their preferred movie.
- **Top Recommendations**: Outputs the top 4 movies matching the user's input.
- **Efficient Performance**: Optimized for quick calculations and recommendations.

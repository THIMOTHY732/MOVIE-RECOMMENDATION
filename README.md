# Movie Recommendation System

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** is designed to suggest movies based on user preferences. By leveraging the **Pandas** library, this system calculates correlations to recommend similar movies. The goal is to provide users with personalized movie suggestions.

This project is an extension of the following repository: [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/THIMOTHY732/MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION.git).  
The dataset used is a subset of the **MovieLens Dataset**.

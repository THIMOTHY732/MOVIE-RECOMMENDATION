<<<<<<< HEAD
It consists of following Analysis and Visualizations:-
1. Cumulative number of case grouped by date
2. Total positive cases in each age group
3. Total cases in India and each of its states and union territories
4. Non-cumulative number of cases grouped by date
5. Total cases per million people in India and each of its states and union territories
6. Age distribution of positive cases in India and each of its states and union territories
7. National descriptive statistics(Ages of all positive cases in India)
8. Correlation between population (or, population density) and total positive cases
9. Public health facilities in India and each of its states and union territories
10. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) testing details
11. States/Union territories and districts with the highest and the lowest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases
12. Important COVID-19 details of India and each of its states and union territories

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** is designed to suggest movies based on user preferences. By leveraging the **Pandas** library, this system calculates correlations to recommend similar movies. The goal is to provide users with personalized movie suggestions.

This project is an extension of the following repository: [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/THIMOTHY732/MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION.git).  
The dataset used is a subset of the **MovieLens Dataset**.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Correlation-Based Recommendations**: Finds movies similar to the one the user inputs.
- **Interactive Input**: Includes a text input bar for users to input their preferred movie.
- **Top Recommendations**: Outputs the top 4 movies matching the user's input.
- **Efficient Performance**: Optimized for quick calculations and recommendations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
- **Dataset**: Subset of the MovieLens Dataset
